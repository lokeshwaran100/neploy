 **Improvised Code.py follow the below instructions** (https://github.com/lokeshwaran100/neploy/blob/main/src/backend/Improvised%20Code.py)
 
 lets get started as how to run and deploy the above along with input 

Install the necessary Python libraries. You can do this using the pip install command:
pip install numpy pandas sklearn

Save the code in a file called code_optimization_model.py.
Create a file called input.txt and add the code snippets that you want to analyze. Each code snippet should be on a separate line.
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the code and input file are saved.
Run the following command to train the model:
python code_optimization_model.py
This will print the classification report for the model.

To predict the suggested improvement for each code snippet, run the following command:
python code_optimization_model.py input.txt
This will print the results for each code snippet.

To deploy the model, you can use a variety of methods, such as:

Saving the model to a file and loading it into a production environment.
Using a cloud-based machine learning service, such as Google Cloud AI Platform or Amazon SageMaker.
Building a web application that uses the model to predict code improvements.
